    <h3>Brittaney Scherer - Coding is the Future!</h3>
    <p>
     My name is Brittaney Scherer and I'm a San Diegan who loves to travel! Aside from traveling, I love working out and learning foreign langauges. I have a Windows and MAC laptop, but I'm using my MAC for coding.
    <p> I have no experience in coding and I knew this class would be a challenge. I had a very difficult time getting my local and hosting environment set up. The websites upgraded some of their tabs and I wasn't certain if I was creating my profiles and preferences correctly. I also had to use google to clarify some of the errors that I was receiving in my Terminal. Overall, I believe both are set up correctly.
